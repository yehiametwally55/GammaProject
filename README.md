# GammaProject
**Version:** 1.0.0
Gamma Function Calculator
Overview
The Gamma Function Calculator is a simple Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that computes the Gamma function for a given input. The application is built using Java Swing and incorporates custom implementations of mathematical functions such as square root, power, sine, logarithm, and exponential to provide accurate results.

Features
User-Friendly GUI: Intuitive and accessible interface built with Java Swing.
Gamma Function Calculation: Computes the Gamma function using the Lanczos approximation.
Custom Math Functions: Includes custom implementations of common mathematical functions.
Error Handling: Validates user input and provides feedback on incorrect inputs.
Accessibility: Designed with accessibility in mind, supporting screen readers and keyboard navigation.
Keyboard Shortcuts: Quick actions using keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Alt+C to compute, Alt+R to reset).
Installation
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK 8 or higher installed on your system.
IDE (Optional): You can use any Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans to run and modify the project.
